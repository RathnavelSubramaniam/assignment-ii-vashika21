1.	Sort flights to find the fastest flights
```{r}
arrange(flights,arr_time)
```
ANSWER:
 arrival time is used to find the fastest flights.
 
 2.	Compare dep_time, sched_dep_time, and dep_delay. How would you expect those three numbers to be related?
```{r}
select(flights,dep_time,sched_dep_time,dep_delay)
```
ANSWER:
 here the dep_delay is found by subtracting sched_dep_time from dep_time. by this way three numbers are related.
 
 3.	Brainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay characteristics of a group of flights. Consider the following scenarios:
a.	A flight is 15 minutes early 50% of the time, and 15 minutes late 50% of the time.
b.	A flight is always 10 minutes late.
c.	A flight is 30 minutes early 50% of the time, and 30 minutes late 50% of the time.
d.	99% of the time a flight is on time. 1% of the time it’s 2 hours late

  
4.	Which plane (tailnum) has the worst on-time record?
```{r}
arrange(flights,desc(arr_delay))
```
ANSWER:
 The plain with tailnum N384HA seems to be worst on time record.
 
5.	Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, and arr_delay from flights.

```{r}
select(flights,"dep_time","dep_delay","arr_time","arr_delay")
```
```{r}
select(flights,4,6,7,9)
```
```{r}
select(flights,starts_with("dep_"))
```
```{r}
select(flights,starts_with("arr_"))
```
```{r}
select(flights,ends_with("_time"),ends_with("_delay"),-c(sched_arr_time,sched_dep_time,air_time))
```
